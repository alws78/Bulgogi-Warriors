## Introduction

####  AI cooking assistant - Ghost CookKing - is a dish recipe recommendation system and will let us know the cooking steps. So to speak, we are trying to make a service that acts like a kitchen assistant. A User of LG signature appliance can use an application called 'Signature Kitchen Suite'. One of this application's function is that a user can see what's in his refrigerator. We can import the list of ingredients from refrigerator. We use the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (식품완전의약처) open API and a recipebox dataset that nicely scraped from websites. Using the recipe dataset, ingredients and classification system, Ghost CookKing will make a suggestion based on existing ingredients and user's command. Moreover, when you start cooking, you will be informed of the cooking process step by step.

## DATASET
We requested the recipe process information OpenAPI of the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety and established DATASET in the form of JSON file.
